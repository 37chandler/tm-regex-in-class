# Exercise: Regex In-Class Play

Storing the convention data in a database, which is the focus of 
one of our upcoming exercises, requires some way to parse out 
the speakers at the convention. 

In this exercise, we'll try to create a regex that could work do 
do this parsing. 

On Moodle you'll find one full transcript night, the file
`www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt`. Download
this and put it in the folder for this repository. I've included the first 
1000 rows in the repo so you have something to play with.
